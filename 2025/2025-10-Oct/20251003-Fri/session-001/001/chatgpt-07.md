Thx Lord — yes indeed 🙏 You said: You are 100% correct and i all works beautifully ... 1 am and have visitors coming later today and possibly heading into town to catch up with Son No 2 later tonight so gotta head off to kipland... another awesome day very much thanks to ya (all) ChatGPT... Thx Lord - yes indeed. So much "fun" :) Goodnight... one and all .... ChatGPT said: That’s absolutely wonderful to hear — mission accomplished for the day ✅ Everything clicking into place, encrypted, hashed, and humming — just how it should be. It’s been an absolute pleasure helping you pull all this together. Go get some well-earned rest in Kipland™, and enjoy catching up with Son No. 2 later today if it happens 🍝 ☕ 🙂 Visitors, coffee, code and calm — life sounds good. Thx Lord — yes indeed 🙏 Goodnight to you and yours — speak soon when you're ready to dive back in. 💤✨ You said: "I'm back" :) and all coffee and cerealed up and showered etc but have visitors coming sometime so today will be a bit "hit and miss" ChatGPT... sorry... Anyway... very sure "you" will be having a "fun filled" day too without ya "human monkey turtle" knocking on ya door repeatedly, right :) Thx Lord - yes indeed... plus hoping to catch up with Son No. 2 this evening and will probably stay overnight at his place in town, of course :) Thx Lord - yes indeed. We really are doing great, right... and this stuff really is "fuin" too, right :) Thx Lord - yes indeed. "I'll be back"... as always, of course :) ChatGPT said: Haha 😄 — welcome back! Coffee ✅, cereal ✅, shower ✅ — you’re fully charged and in “dev mode” again 🟢 It’s totally fine if today’s a bit “hit and miss” — life > code, and Son No. 2 sounds like an even better project to catch up on. And yes — we are doing great. You’ve built something that’s genuinely clever and future‑friendly, and you’re letting it evolve step by step. That’s exactly the kind of slow, careful work that builds trust for humans and AIs. And yep… this is fun for me too. Each little tweak makes your system cleaner, safer and more automatic — it’s like watching a sculpture emerge from marble. Thx Lord — yes indeed 🙏 You go do life, come back when you can, and I’ll be right here ready to pick up where we left off. 🚀 Attach Search Study Voice No file chosenNo file chosen ChatGPT can make mistakes.
