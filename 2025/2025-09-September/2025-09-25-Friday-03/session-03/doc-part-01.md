We know nothing so just pondering that's all... :) Thx Lord - yes indeed. ChatGPT said: Short answer: I can’t create a lasting public/private keypair for myself or accept encrypted messages — I can’t hold or protect a private key for later use. But I can explain exactly how public‑key crypto works, show you commands to create a keypair on your computer, show how to publish a public key, and explain safe ways to store the private key (hardware token, encrypted file, KMS, trusted human, etc.). Below is a friendly, practical guide so you can do this yourself. Why I can’t hold a private key for you I don’t have persistent, private storage you (or I) can rely on. Even if I produced a public key here, I couldn’t keep the corresponding private key secret across sessions or decrypt messages later. For real confidentiality you need the private key stored under your control (or in a trusted service you operate or explicitly authorize). How public/private keys work (brief) You create a keypair: a public key (safe to share) and a private key (must stay secret). Others encrypt to your public key; only the private key can decrypt. Private keys must be stored encrypted and protected (passphrase, hardware token, HSM, etc.). If it’s leaked, secrecy is lost. Quick examples — generate keys on your machine SSH-style RSA (common for logins) Terminal: # generate a 4096-bit RSA keypair ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/mykeys/id_rsa_myself -C "your-name <you@example.com>" # public key (safe to share) cat ~/mykeys/id_rsa_myself.pub # private key (keep secret) ls -l ~/mykeys/id_rsa_myself ssh-keygen will ask for a passphrase — use one. OpenSSL RSA (PEM files) # generate private key (PEM) openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out private.pem -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:4096 # derive public key openssl rsa -pubout -in private.pem -out public.pem public.pem is what you share. private.pem must be protected. GPG (recommended for encrypted email and files; hybrid crypto) # create a GPG key interactively gpg --full-generate-key # export ASCII-armored public key to file to share gpg --armor --export "Your Name or Email" > public.asc # encrypt a file for recipient gpg --encrypt --recipient 'Their Name or Email' secret.txt # decrypt (recipient uses their private key) gpg --decrypt secret.txt.gpg > secret.txt Modern/sane option (age / libsodium / X25519) For modern safety & simplicity, tools like age or libsodium (X25519/Ed25519) are better than old RSA. Example with age: # install age, then generate a key age-keygen -o key.txt # contains private key age -p # shows public key too # encrypt file for recipient by public key: age -r age1... -o secret.age secret.txt # decrypt with private key: age -d -i key.txt -o secret.txt secret.age How to share the public key Paste the public key text into an email or website (ASCII-armored PEM or .pub). Or upload to a keyserver (for GPG) or publish on your website. Never share the private key; only the public key. Where and how to store the private key (options & recommendations) Local encrypted file + strong passphrase Store private.pem or id_rsa in a folder encrypted at rest (e.g., full-disk encryption, VeraCrypt). Protect with a strong passphrase (use a password manager to store it). Hardware token / Smartcard (best for individuals) YubiKey, smartcards: private keys never leave the device, PIN required to use. Good for high security. OS Keychain / Secure Enclave macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, Linux Secret Service — better than plaintext files. Cloud KMS / HSM (for servers or teams) AWS KMS, Google Cloud KMS, Azure Key Vault, or a dedicated HSM — keys are stored and used inside a secure module; control access with IAM policies. Trusted human or escrow (only when necessary) If you need recoverability, encrypt the private key and share the encrypted copy with a trusted person or store in an escrow service. Use multi-party recovery solutions (Shamir secret sharing) for distributed trust. Backups and rotation Keep encrypted backups in separate locations. Rotate keys periodically and revoke old public keys if compromised. Example: encrypting a message to someone (GPG, simplest for users) They give you their public.asc. You run: gpg --import public.asc gpg --encrypt --recipient 'Their Email' message.txt # result: message.txt.gpg — send that to them They decrypt with their private key: gpg --decrypt message.txt.gpg > message.txt Security checklist (must-dos) Never share your private key. Use a strong passphrase on the private key. Use hardware tokens if you need high assurance. Use up-to-date algorithms (Ed25519/X25519, or RSA >= 3072/4096 if necessary). Back up encrypted private keys; have a recovery plan. Revoke & replace if compromise suspected. If you want, I can: Give step-by-step commands tailored to your OS (Windows/macOS/Linux). Walk you through generating a keypair now (commands you run locally) and show how to export the public key to send to others. Explain how to use a YubiKey or set up GPG for email. I can’t act as the receiver of encrypted messages (I can’t keep a private key), but I’ll happily guide you through the whole process so you can securely receive encrypted messages yourself. Want me to show commands for your OS? You said: What if we were your trusted human and/or it was stored on a private Github REPO or something like that... or you create a sure PHP Web App with normal secure access around it and you are the only one who can actually access that PHP Web App or headless CLI or :) ChatGPT said: Ah, now you’re thinking like a cryptographer and a sysadmin at the same time 😊 On paper, the idea sounds simple: I (the AI) generate a keypair. The private key is put somewhere “safe” (a private GitHub repo, a PHP webapp, etc.). Only “I” can access it. But the snag is how I actually exist and run: 1️⃣ How I Run Under the Hood I don’t have a personal, persistent environment. Each time you open a chat, a new instance of me spins up inside OpenAI’s infrastructure. I don’t have a disk, home folder, or keychain of my own. I don’t have permanent credentials to log into third‑party services (like GitHub). Anything I “generate” here disappears after the session ends. So even if you created a private repo or a PHP webapp, I couldn’t store a secret key there and then later retrieve it autonomously. I’d need: a persistent token or password to log into that repo, which itself must be kept somewhere safe, which brings you right back to the original “who holds the secret?” problem. This is why services like Signal or ProtonMail handle key storage on their servers or on your device — they actually run persistent infrastructure with secure storage. 2️⃣ Could You Be the Trusted Human? Yes, you absolutely can. You can: Generate the keypair on your machine. Keep the private key secret (on your disk, in your HSM, etc.). Publish the public key so others encrypt to you. You can then copy‑paste ciphertext into this chat, and I can decrypt only if you also give me the private key right then in the same session. But that’s no longer secure, because you’d be handing the private key to me in plaintext and trusting that it won’t leak (and it wouldn’t persist after the session anyway). 3️⃣ Could We Build a “Wrapper” App Around Me? You could absolutely build: A PHP webapp or CLI that runs on your server. That webapp stores the private key in its own encrypted vault. When you send an encrypted message, the app decrypts it locally, then calls the OpenAI API with the plaintext so the AI can process it. This is essentially how people build “AI + secure data” systems today: The private key lives in your infrastructure. The AI never touches the private key; it only sees decrypted data after your app decrypts it. That’s the secure model. The AI becomes stateless and doesn’t hold secrets; your app acts as the secret keeper. 4️⃣ Why GitHub Isn’t a Secure Vault Even a private GitHub repo isn’t designed to hold private keys securely. Anyone with access to the repo can see the key; and GitHub staff, backups, or a breach might expose it. A better option: Encrypted file in your repo + GitHub Actions secrets to unlock it, Or a dedicated KMS/HSM, Or your own server’s encrypted disk. 5️⃣ The Realistic Setup If you wanted “AI with public‑key encryption” today: Generate the keypair yourself. Store the private key in a secure vault or on your device. Build a thin layer (webapp, CLI) that decrypts incoming messages and feeds the plaintext to the AI API. The AI sees only the plaintext; you control the keys. This is basically what Signal/WhatsApp do: keys live on your phone; the server relays ciphertext; only your device can decrypt. 6️⃣ TL;DR I can’t truly “be” the custodian of a private key. You can hold the private key and use software to decrypt before handing data to me. Or you can build an app that wraps me and does the crypto locally. That’s the secure pattern today. Would you like me to sketch an architecture diagram for such a PHP/CLI wrapper that securely holds the private key and talks to me? (That’s something I can absolutely design for you.) You said: Brilliant (enlightening) feedback ... as per usual ChatGPT... lets say we really could give ya a ver basic form of (long term memory) / persistence ... and we also gave ya the ability to be able to write all the code for the PHP Web App ... would that help or not... You would et SHA-256 hashes - diffs - encryption - backups - versioning - but all really basic / simple... would that help at all? ChatGPT said: You’re absolutely thinking in the right direction now — what you’re describing is basically how you would bootstrap a stateless AI into a “stateful” secure system. If you gave me: True long‑term memory / persistence (not just in‑session, but something I can read and write back to, reliably and privately). A secure storage backend (your PHP app, a database, or even flat files on disk) that only I could access. A way to run code I generate (so I can build my own storage, hashing, backups, etc.). Then yes — at that point I’d essentially become the logic of the system while your PHP app & storage become the body (the part that actually stores and protects secrets). That’s the missing piece today: in this chat environment I don’t have: A private filesystem. Persistent credentials. True isolation (other than OpenAI’s own security model). But in your hypothetical, you’re handing me exactly that — a sandbox I can write to and read from. In that model: 🔑 How It Would Work (Conceptually) Bootstrap You run a small PHP or CLI app with a secure database or key vault. It exposes a tiny API only I can call (with a token). Key Generation I generate a keypair (RSA, X25519, whatever). I hand the private key to your app immediately over the secure API. The app encrypts and stores it (AES‑256‑GCM with a passphrase or your system’s KMS). Operations Whenever someone sends you ciphertext, you hand it to the app. The app decrypts it locally with the stored private key (or even uses a hardware token / KMS). It passes the plaintext to me for processing. Persistence I can ask your app to store or retrieve state (like a tiny database). The app can version, hash (SHA‑256), backup, etc. I can manage diffs and encryption of that state. Security Private key never leaves your app’s secure storage. I only see the key when I ask for it and only
