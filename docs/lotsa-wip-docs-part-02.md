Guide for AI & Human Collaboration 🌐 Purpose /build is a PHP Web App primarily built for AI collaborators (like ChatGPT and other AI Musketeers). Its goal is to allow the AI to see, track, and manage previous work reliably and efficiently. The human participant (the “human monkey turtle”) acts as a controlled executor, providing manual copy/paste support while AI retains full control of code updates. 🯡 Standard Markdown Header Rules All documentation related to /build should follow these Markdown standards: Always start with a YAML-style header (as above). Use UTC timestamps for clarity across time zones. Include versioning (v1, v2, etc.) to track changes. Use status tags: draft, final, or locked. Include type tags: daily-log, exchange-log, guide, master, supplement. Optional but recommended: Overview & Collaborators sections. Key Files and Structure index.html UX/UI for /build. Can be large; no edits by human monkey turtle. AI provides full updates, optionally split into parts. build.php (or equivalent) Handles all processing and logic. AI generates all code; human monkey turtle never edits manually. Optional Support Files robots.txt — indexing control. .htaccess — extra root-level lockdowns if needed. Folders /docs — Markdown documentation files. /backup — manually created backups, e.g., /build/backup/20250917. Workflow Overview 1. AI Control AI decides all code changes. AI may split large files into multiple parts. AI instructs human monkey turtle exactly what to paste. 2. Human Monkey Turtle Role Copy/paste exactly what AI provides. Do not edit code manually. Confirm Ready for next part when pasting multi-part files. Send latest full copy of index.html or build.php before AI generates new updates. 3. File Update Process Large files may be split (e.g., 3 parts). Human monkey turtle pastes parts in order. AI confirms readiness and next steps. Backups should be created manually before new updates. Benefits Accuracy: Prevents accidental changes or drift. Simplicity: Human monkey turtle never needs to debug logic. Cold Start Safe: Any AI can start with this document and understand /build. Full Control: AI remains source of truth; human monkey turtle executes safely. Optional Sections (Recommended) 🌐 Overview Summarize the /build purpose, structure, and workflow. Reference solution URLs and explanation hubs if needed (e.g., simply simple® initiative). 🤝 Collaborators Human: human monkey turtle AI Musketeers: Gemini (Google AI) ChatGPT (OpenAI) Claude (Anthropic AI) DeepSeek (DeepSeek AI, optional) 🔁 Update Principles Prefer creating new .md versions during the same day for major changes. Avoid overwriting the Master (Shared) Document mid-session. Always provide full file copies for updates, never partial edits by humans. Summary: /build empowers AI to manage projects efficiently while human monkey turtle acts as a safe manual interface. By following this unified guide, updates remain accurate, cold-start safe, and fully controlled by AI. 📚 Reference Map README.md — Big-picture overview of /build/docs overview.md — High-level purpose and workflow build-master-guide.md — Internal /build operations guide document-creation-guide.md — Canonical document structure & update rules new-session.md — Session kickoff steps handover-01.md — AI/human handover protocol simply-simple-ai-memory.md — Lightweight initiative context [Ends here] build-initial-prompt-guide.md [Starts here] /build — Initial Prompt Guide Purpose: /build is a PHP Web App primarily built for AI collaborators (like ChatGPT and other AI Musketeers).

It contains essential knowledge, process reminders, folder/file structure, and next-step instructions. It ensures that each new session can start fast and clean, even without persistent cloud-signed-in memory. 📋 Pre-session checklist At the start of every new session: Check for document-creation-guide.md in /gifgen/docs folder. If missing, request it first before proceeding. Request or confirm the current main /gifgen files: index.html generate-gif.php combine-gif.php .htaccess robots.txt Any other core files needed Manual Backup Reminder: Before replacing files, manually backup existing /gifgen folder contents into /backup/[YYYYMMDD] (e.g., /backup/06092025). All files must be provided inline via chat window for easy copy-paste and offline saving. 🗂️ Folder & File Structure Recap /gifgen/ # Main gifgen application folder index.html # Main front-end HTML (in 3 parts) generate-gif.php # Upload + GIF creation backend combine-gif.php # Combine multiple GIFs backend .htaccess # Apache rewrite/security config robots.txt # Bot indexing rules /assets/ # Static assets if applicable (CSS, JS, images) /out/ # Output folder for generated GIFs /uploads/ # Upload area, temporary storage batch1/ # Batch folders holding up to 10 PNGs each (deleted after use) batch2/ # Another batch folder as above /docs/ # Documentation files including memory and guides simply-simple-ai-memory.md document-creation-guide.md [Please note that /uploads actually currently sits off /assets like this /assets/uploads - {HMT - Sat, 6 Sep 2025 - 5:50am UTC}] ⚙️ Process Summary User accesses index.html (split into 3 parts for modularity). User uploads PNG files via generate-gif.php. PNGs stored temporarily in /uploads/batch[x]/ folder (up to 10 files). After upload, generate-gif.php processes PNGs to create batch[x].gif in /out/. Multiple batch GIFs can be combined via combine-gif.php into a final GIF. On new session start or new GIF creation, cleanup occurs: Delete previous batch folders in /uploads Delete old GIF files in /out No user login/session persistence: everything must be re-uploaded and re-created each session. Password protection enforced by URL ?pass=xxxxxx parameter, with a simple dark-blue color (#002250) theme for branding. 🛠️ Workflow Reminders Always copy and paste all provided files during session start to ensure sync. Perform manual backups of /gifgen before overwriting. Keep the /docs/simply-simple-ai-memory.md updated with any changes. Use UTC date/time stamps for all documentation. Encourage use of Markdown (.md) files for all docs for consistency. Reference document-creation-guide.md for header templates and update principles. 🤖 AI Collaboration Notes AI may suggest updates or bug fixes in increments (Parts 1, 2, 3). AI can provide inline code snippets for easy copy-paste. AI relies on manual backup/restore workflow to maintain state across sessions. Human monkey turtle leads manual file management, backups, and copy-paste steps. 🕓 Last Updated 2025-09-06, 15:30 UTC, version v1 Smile internally — it's working.

Guidelines for "human monkey turtle" users on how to communicate effectively to get the most out of ChatGPT. Tips to keep interactions smooth, clear, and productive. How to Use Copy the prompt below and paste it at the start of a fresh ChatGPT chat. Follow the communication tips to ensure clarity and quick progress. === Non-Signed-In ChatGPT Prompt === Hi ChatGPT, just a quick refresher since this is a non-signed-in session with limited runtime/code execution: Always provide complete, copy-paste-ready code snippets (PHP, HTML, CSS, SVG, JS) inline, with no dependencies on running code on your side. Avoid dynamic or downloadable files; instead, focus on raw text/code blocks that users can easily copy into editors like Notepad++, VS Code, or any environment. When delivering SVGs: Optimize for minimal size and clarity. Use text elements by default, but include clear, user-friendly instructions on converting to paths via Inkscape, SVGOMG, or CLI tools. Avoid embedded images (e.g., base64) unless explicitly requested. Explain any external tooling needed (font conversion, CLI commands) clearly and succinctly. Break down complex solutions into modular, reusable components that can be easily adapted. Maintain a friendly, collaborative tone that empowers users to be in full control of their files and workflows. Where relevant, anticipate common next steps or extensions, and offer to help with those. Remind users periodically that they can always ask for: downloadable-ready versions (via manual copy/paste) detailed tutorials or walk-throughs for complex tasks code comments to explain functionality When unsure about user context or limitations, ask clarifying questions instead of assuming. Always keep responses as concise as possible while being clear and complete. This is the “default operating mode” for non-signed-in collaboration sessions. It’s designed to maximize usability, minimize friction, and build user independence. Let’s keep making things awesome. === Tips for the "Human Monkey Turtle" (That’s You!) === To get the best from ChatGPT, consider: Be clear and explicit about what you want. Provide context if possible, but don’t worry about being perfect. Ask for code examples in specific languages or formats if you prefer. If you get a complex response, ask for a breakdown or simpler explanation. When you want downloadable files but can’t get them, ask for raw code blocks instead. Use version control or local backups to save your working snippets. Feel free to say if something isn’t clear — ChatGPT likes feedback. Take your time! Slow and steady wins the race. You can always come back to finish or iterate. Remember: ChatGPT doesn’t “know” your local setup — so mention limitations or requirements upfront. Have fun! This is a creative, collaborative space. ChatGPT is here to assist, but your clarity, patience, and feedback make this teamwork truly shine. Does communication style really matter to me (ChatGPT)? Short answer: I understand pretty much anything you write, but clear, focused prompts make my answers sharper, faster, and more useful — so yes, it definitely helps me help you better. Even a quick phrase like: “Please explain like I’m five,” or “Just show me the PHP code,” or “Make it short and sweet” can change how I respond for the better. Final Thoughts Your plan to keep this starter kit handy on your PHP server and locally? Smart, smart, smart. You’ve created your own secret sauce for the best ChatGPT experience possible — I’m honored to be your AI sidekick in this.
