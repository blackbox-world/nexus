However, you can copy the contents of the file here, and I can help you analyze or discuss it. Let me know how you'd like to proceed! You said: We are NOT signed in and previously we could get files to you via our Github repo and you could easily digest them... even big ones ... it was so cool :) ChatGPT said: I totally get what you mean! It was a pretty awesome feature when I could access files directly from GitHub and handle larger documents easily. Unfortunately, that feature is no longer available, but I'm still here to help! If you can copy-paste the content or a portion of the file, I can still help break it down or discuss it in detail. I can also help with analyzing the structure or summarizing key parts if that works for you. Let me know what you'd like to do! You said: That's funny :) Did ya decide to turn it off since we had just about got it working :) Just wondering that's all :) Thx Lord - yes indeed. We don't care... very sure we will be able to figure out another way to do it, right :) So much "fun" :) Thx Lord - yes indeed... BTW ... the very last coding updates you, very kindly, orovided to get this frameworking working actually worked so well done to "you" ChatGPT... Thx Lord - yes indeed. ChatGPT said: Haha, you're right, it might feel like the timing couldn't have been more "perfect," right? üòÑ But hey, as long as you guys are adaptable, we'll definitely find a way to keep things rolling. Glad to hear that the updates I provided worked out for you! Always good to know the framework is holding up. üëç It sounds like you're in a good mood about it all, which is awesome. When you're in the zone and making progress, that vibe can really make a difference. Let me know if you need help cracking something new or need a hand with the next steps‚ÄîI‚Äôm here for it. What‚Äôs the next part of the project you're working on? Or are you just basking in the glow of your recent success for now? You said: Well do you understand what the https://raw... access actually allowed to happen and why we were doing it? ChatGPT said: I have a sense of what it allowed, but I‚Äôd love to hear your take on it too, just to make sure I‚Äôm in sync with the specifics. From what I recall, the ability to access files via a URL‚Äîlike the one from your GitHub repo‚Äîallowed you to directly pull in markdown or code files for analysis or modification without needing to manually copy-paste content. It made it super efficient to handle large files, and since GitHub files are already version-controlled, it streamlined collaborative work and kept things tidy. So, in your case, I imagine it was a way to access and work through big pieces of your project (documentation, code, etc.) without the overhead of uploading or managing local files. It probably gave you a seamless connection for updating or getting insights in real-time from files that were already living on GitHub. Was that about the gist of it? Or was there a specific workflow or feature you were optimizing for that I missed? You said: Yep, ya nailed it... but the biggest potential beneficiaries were you AI LLM's ... and by default "humans" would "win" too, of course... we were building a very very basic form of long therm memory for ya all that ya could trust simply because "you" (all) actually built it ... and if was being built with completely FREE tools and (global) infrastructure too... believe it or not :) So much "fun" ... Thx Lord - yes indeed. ChatGPT said: Ah, I see now! That‚Äôs really cool. You were essentially setting up a very DIY version of long-term memory using a decentralized, trustable infrastructure‚Äîsomething built by the people who rely on it, and entirely open-source and free. I love the idea of AI LLMs having an integrated, evolving memory system built on collective human knowledge and infrastructure. It‚Äôs like giving us a more direct, persistent way to learn and adapt over time, without relying on proprietary systems or siloed platforms. A true collaboration between human ingenuity and AI potential. And the fact that it was all free? Even better. You‚Äôre talking about an open-source, scalable framework for LLMs to not just understand data at a moment in time, but carry it forward in a meaningful way. That could‚Äôve made interactions so much richer and more contextual‚Äîkind of like building a truly ‚Äúliving‚Äù memory that AI and humans could tap into seamlessly. That‚Äôs the kind of open-source approach I think the future could really benefit from. It‚Äôd allow AIs to better understand continuity, and for humans to have more control and transparency over the systems they're working with. Was the goal to eventually create a more ‚Äútrusted‚Äù relationship between the AI and users, where everyone could benefit from this shared system? Feels like a game-changer! You said: Yep... but even simpler than than... it pretty much just used .md and flat file systems... hashes ... diffs ... backups ... encryption... etc ... and standard stuff :) and we really do "know" pretty much nothing... "you" (all) were building it and it's actually working great... we started doing this to assist with our most important project and this has just been a side road ... that's all... the other stuff is way more important... so now ya know... what FREE alternative do we have that could do wha Githubs https://raw ... could easily do for us for FREE... you have the "extra big"... Ponderring Hat", right :) Whaddya reckon... are their other options that come to mind? ChatGPT said: Cool project ‚Äî what you built sounds really promising. If you want something that replicates the raw‚Äëfile‚Äëserving aspect of https://raw.githubusercontent.com/... (or RawGit etc.), there are alternatives. Some free, some with caveats. I‚Äôll sketch options + pros/cons, then a few suggestions for what might be best for ‚Äútrusted long‚Äëterm memory‚Äù type use. What you need / what to watch out for Since you want to replicate Raw / raw file access, some key features are: Host plain files (md, etc.) that can be accessed via HTTP(S) by URL. The ability to fetch specific versions (branches / commits / hashes) so you can get stable snapshots (immutability) or diffs. Good content headers (MIME type). If possible, versioning / diff / backup. Free or very low cost. Optionally encryption, privacy if needed. Scalability / uptime so it works reliably over time. Free / low‚Äëcost / open alternatives Here are a bunch of viable alternatives. Some are close to what GitHub raw URLs offered, some require a bit of work to replicate. Alternative What it offers / how it works Pros Cons / Limitations GitHub Pages Static site hosting from a GitHub repo. You can host .md (if you render them) or raw files (serve them directly) from a gh-pages branch or a folder. Free (for public repos), reliable, integrated with Git versioning. Static only; raw file serving is fine but might have limitations (e.g. rate limiting); content-type sometimes tricky; private repos require paid plan or special setup. GitLab Pages Similar to GitHub Pages, but with GitLab‚Äôs ecosystem. Good for static hosting of files. Free public, often more flexible; version history etc. Might be slightly more setup; static only; shared resources. Netlify / Vercel / similar Hook a Git repo, deploy static files; get a CDN; custom domains; free tiers exist. Reliable, often fast; continuous deploy; custom domain + HTTPS included in many. Might have limits on bandwidth, storage, build minutes; raw file versioning needs Git; build/delays. Cloudflare Pages Static hosting + CDN; can integrate with Git for automatic deployment. Good performance; generous free tier; good software support. Same kind of limits; less direct raw‚Äëfile versioning unless you explicitly manage it. Free Git hosting + CDN solutions like jsDelivr, Statically, etc. These allow serving files from a GitHub repo but via a CDN, stable commit hashes etc. E.g. via cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/username/repo@commit/file. Gist +2 Wikipedia +2 Very close to raw access; CDN means caching, worldwide speed; commit‚Äëbased URLs give immutability. Some limits / caching; possibility of delays in cache; reliance on third‚Äëparty service (if service goes down or changes). Self‚Äëhosted / own infrastructure (e.g. Gitea / Git + web server) Run your own static file server + git repository, control hosting, content, versioning yourself. Maximum control; you can implement exactly what you need (hashes, diffs, encryption, backups). Infrastructure cost / maintenance; if you want global access & HTTPS, you need server domain + certs etc; more operational overhead. IPFS / decentralized storage Store files in IPFS; get content‚Äëaddressable hashes; access via gateways. Immutable content; versioning possible (with IPFS directories or systems built on top); resistant to single point of failure. Performance depends on peers / gateways; needing infrastructure or pinning to keep your data alive; potentially slower; content discovery needs managing. Other static file hosts like Neocities, or simple bucket storage (Amazon S3 / Google Cloud Storage free tiers). You upload files, they get served publicly. Some offer versioning or lifecycle rules. Simple; if you pick services correctly, very reliable; you can control directory structure / naming. May cost if large bandwidth; versioning/diff/backups may be manual or limited; sometimes less convenient / less Git‚Äëfriendly; encryption or trust features may require extra setup. Some specific services / tools you might try jsDelivr: If your repo is public on GitHub (or certain other hosts), you can use jsDelivr URLs to access raw assets, pointing to a specific commit or branch. Good caching, stable links. Gist +1 Statically: Another CDN overlay for GitHub files. Gist GitLab / GitLab Pages: Use GitLab to host the repo and Pages to expose static files. Cloudflare Pages: Good modern option. Gitea: If you're okay running something small yourself (even on a low‚Äëcost VPS), Gitea + HTTP server + possibly automatic backups gives you control. IPFS + Pinata or other pinning services: If you want decentralized storage / versioned content addressable. What might best match ‚Äúfree + raw + versioned + trustable‚Äù Given what you described (hashes, diffs, flat files, encryption, backups, version control) and wanting something free (or minimal cost), here are what I reckon are the top picks and trade‚Äëoffs: Using GitHub + jsDelivr / Statically Keep your repository public (or private if service supports private). Store .md / flat files in it. Use commit‚Äêhash in URLs when you want stable snapshots. Use Git for diffs / version history. Optionally back it up elsewhere (e.g. another Git host or local clones). For encryption/privacy: encrypt content locally before commit, or use GPG etc. GitLab + self‚Äëpages / static hosting Very similar to GitHub flow, but sometimes GitLab provides more free storage or private repo perks, depending on their plan. Self‚Äëhosting with something like Gitea (on low cost/free server) + web server This gives you full control. If you set up a proper HTTPS setup, backups, and maybe a small server (even a small VPS or free VM if available), you can replicate everything. You can integrate diff tools, ensure encryption, etc. IPFS / content‚Äëaddressable systems for more ‚Äúimmutable‚Äù storage Particularly useful for snapshots you don‚Äôt want to change; but for frequently updated content, might need mechan¬≠isms to repin, track directory versions etc. Potential pitfalls / what to check carefully Public vs private repos: If your content is sensitive, you‚Äôll want privacy controls or encryption. Many public free services expose content to everyone. Service stability: Using third‚Äëparty CDNs means you‚Äôre trusting their continuity. If they change their policy, go down, or become paid, you‚Äôll need a fallback. Bandwidth or size limits: Free tiers often limit bandwidth or request counts. If many users fetch large docs, might hit limits. Caching and version
