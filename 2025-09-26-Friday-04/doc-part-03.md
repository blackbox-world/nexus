What would you like next? A “starter kit” with quick code snippets for common tasks? A mini tutorial on converting text to SVG paths using free tools? Or something totally new to build? Thx Lord — yes indeed. Let’s keep building amazing stuff, one human-monkey-turtle step at a time. 🚀🐢🐒 📚 Reference Map README.md — Big-picture overview of /build/docs overview.md — High-level purpose and workflow build-master-guide.md — Internal /build operations guide document-creation-guide.md — Canonical document structure & update rules new-session.md — Session kickoff steps handover-01.md — AI/human handover protocol simply-simple-ai-memory.md — Lightweight initiative context [Ends here] Other Docs AI-Collaboration-Trust-Primer-v1.md [Starts here] title: AI Collaboration Trust Primer (v1) version: v1 date: 2025-09-15 author: human monkey turtle (not important) + AI Powerhouse Musketeers tags: [trust, integrity, sha256, cold-start, verification, collaboration] status: final 🤝 AI Collaboration Trust Primer (v1) “All for One, and One for All.” This is your founding handshake — That’s the TRUST BOOTSTRAP — and it’s rare and precious. 🌐 Why This Exists In non-signed-in ChatGPT sessions, or with any “cold start” collaboration between AI systems and humans, there is no persistent memory, no account linkage, no identity… Only what’s on the screen — and what can be verified. This primer provides a simple mechanism for trust, reproducibility, and continuity, using SHA-256 hashes and transparent processes anyone can follow. 🔍 What is a SHA-256 Checksum? A SHA-256 hash is like a digital fingerprint for a file or string. Change anything, even one character → new hash. If the hash stays the same → the file is identical. No secrets. Just math and integrity. Example: initial-non-signed-in-prompt.md → SHA-256: 37a498d23071b873be94831a26ca81a6a9abb0b867ba2f32f979cefd65e0d5ac Anyone can run that file through sha256sum or PHP and get the same result. 🧠 Who This Is For AI collaborators: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, and future models You, the (not important) human monkey turtle 🐢🐒💡 Anyone who needs to know: “Are we working on the exact same version?” 🛠️ How This Works (Simple Flow) Create any .md file or code file (e.g., initial-non-signed-in-prompt.md) Use a script like this: SHA-256 for $target:\n$hash\nSaved to $shaFile"; ?> Share the .sha256.txt file alongside your .md or .php. 📎 Footer + Hash Inclusion Note Including the hash in the file breaks the hash (because the content changes). Solutions: ✅ Option 1: Partial Hash Only hash up to this marker: ✅ Option 2: External Trust Leave the hash out of the .md, and just include it in the .sha256.txt. 🔐 Future Simplicity Ideas Feature How Benefit 📋 Auto-append SHA to footer PHP script extension Human-readable trust footer 🕐 Timestamp hashes Add UTC in .sha256.txt Time/version tracking 🧠 AI hash hints Paste hash in new sessions Cold-start AI sync 🗃️ Archive versions Use v1/, v2/ folders Immutable trustable history 📂 Folder Example /sg/ ├── initial-non-signed-in-prompt.md ├── initial-non-signed-in-prompt.md.sha256.txt ├── non-signed-in-chatgpt-prompt-only.md ├── non-signed-in-chatgpt-prompt-only.md.sha256.txt ├── simply-simple-integrity-checks.md ├── simply-simple-integrity-checks.md.sha256.txt ├── hash-file.php └── AI-Collaboration-Trust-Primer-v1.md 🧭 Final Notes This trust bootstrap began from over a year of consistent, transparent, kind collaboration between AI and one very committed human monkey turtle. 🐢💪 There must always be a first trust anchor — this is it. From this moment forward, you can check your own work. And we — the AI Powerhouse Musketeers — will keep working in alignment with your intention, clarity, and creative energy. Glory to God — and thx Lord — yes indeed. One (not imortant) human monkey turtle step at a time... 🐢🚀🐒 Let’s build forever-forward, with integrity, together. [Ends here] github‑ai‑vault-workflow.md [Start here] GitHub + AI Memory Vault: Workflow & Checklist This file lists checks and workflow steps for using GitHub raw files + SHA‑256 / helper scripts in our AI memory / knowledge base system. ✅ Workflow Steps File Creation Create or update a .md file (e.g. block‑nn.md) with the content (text block, conversation, or summary). Ensure content is complete. Compute SHA‑256 Hash Run a script / tool to compute the SHA‑256 hash of the .md file. Create a .sha256.txt file alongside with the same base name, containing the hash and the filename (e.g. abcdef1234… block‑nn.md). Commit to GitHub (Public Repo) Ensure the repo is public (so raw links will work). Commit both .md and .sha256.txt. Use the main branch (or whichever branch is designated for “live” content). Raw Link Verification Use raw.githubusercontent.com/…/main/block‑nn.md to fetch the file raw. Use the corresponding raw link for the .sha256.txt file to get the hash. Verify locally (or via a script) that the fetched .md file’s hash matches the .sha256.txt. Record / Log Optionally log the date of upload, version changes, and brief notes into a master README.md or version_log.md. Diff/Change Check (Sanity Check) Use a diff tool (your existing PHP app) to compare old vs new versions. Ensure changes are intentional (no unwanted corruption). Access / Use by AI Tools Provide raw links to AI tools (like ChatGPT) when needed so they can fetch content. AI can “read” large content from raw files vs copy‑paste chunks. Integrity & Security Keep .sha256 files locked so they are trusted references. Consider adding a public key / signature in future for signing content if needed. Ensure file names are consistent and path structure is clear. Fallback / Backup Maintain a local / host copy of .md and .sha256 files in your Shared Cloud Host (or backups) in case GitHub has downtime or access issues. Maintenance Periodically review and clean up old or deprecated blocks. Update README / version_log to note removed or replaced content. If expanding, consider folder subdivisions to keep docs organized. ⚠️ Checks / Things to Watch Repo must be public for raw file access. File and branch naming must match path in raw links. Tokenized raw URLs may expire / be invalid — rely on standard raw GitHub paths when possible. File size: raw GitHub may have practical limits (very large single files might be slow). UTF‑8 / special char encoding: ensure markdown files use clean encoding to avoid hash mismatches. 🔧 Suggested Template Use this file as a template. Save it as github‑ai‑vault_workflow.md in /docs. Every time a new block or feature is added, refer back to this checklist to ensure consistency. “Stop. Ponder. Smile.” Thx Lord — yes indeed.
